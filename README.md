This are my personal schematics to be used to build stuff in [Minecraft](https://minecraft.net) using the [Litematica](https://github.com/maruohon/litematica) mod.

Just drop these into the schematics directory of your Minecraft install directory - it should exist, once you started the game with the mod active.
